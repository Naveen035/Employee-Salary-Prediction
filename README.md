This project focuses on predicting employee salaries based solely on their experience level and position. Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor algorithms were employed to establish a relationship between these factors and salary. Pandas was used for data handling, while Streamlit provided a user-friendly interface for inputting employee details and receiving predicted salary estimates. The trained model was pickled to ensure reusability.
