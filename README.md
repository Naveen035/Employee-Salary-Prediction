# 💼 **Employee Salary Prediction**

### **Abstract**
Predicting employee salaries accurately is crucial for organizations to maintain competitive compensation structures. This project aims to predict **employee salaries** based on their **experience level** and **position** using machine learning techniques. The analysis helps uncover trends and establish a model that provides salary estimates for various employee profiles.

### **🚩 Problem Statement**
The objective is to develop a predictive model that estimates salaries based on experience and position. By analyzing this relationship, organizations can create more competitive and fair compensation packages, attracting and retaining talent.

### **📚 Project Description**
In this project, we use a dataset containing information about employees, such as their **experience level** and **job position**. The goal is to establish a model that accurately predicts salaries based on these features. **Linear Regression** and **Decision Tree Regressor** algorithms are used to model the relationship between the input features and salary.

### **🎯 Desired Outcome**
The main objective is to build a predictive model that can estimate an employee’s salary based on their experience level and position, providing organizations with insights into compensation trends and enabling more accurate salary planning. 💡

### **🧠 Algorithms**
- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**

### **🛠️ Technologies Used**
- **Pandas**: For efficient data handling and manipulation.
- **Streamlit**: To create a user-friendly interface for entering employee details and displaying salary predictions.
- **Pickle**: Used to save and load the trained models, ensuring reusability and easy deployment.

### **📊 About the Data**
The dataset includes the following features:
- **Experience Level**: The number of years an employee has worked in the industry.
- **Job Position**: The title or role of the employee within the organization.
- **Salary**: The salary associated with the employee’s position and experience level (used as the target variable).

### **🔧 Getting Started**
Clone the repository and ensure the required Python libraries (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, Streamlit) are installed to explore the code and run the prediction model locally.

### **🚀 Next Steps**
- Experiment with other **regression algorithms** like **Random Forest Regressor** or **Support Vector Regressor** for potential improvement in accuracy.
- Incorporate additional features such as **location** or **industry type** for a more comprehensive model.
- Develop a **dashboard** using Streamlit to visualize salary trends and predictions. 📈
